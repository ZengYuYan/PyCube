# PyCube

PyCube is an 3D interactive Rubik's Cube using OpenGL and Pygame.

### Purpose
This software-based Rubik's Cube will serve as a basis for a later
project in which I will attempt to create another program, implementing
a neural network algorithm, that will teach itself to solve a Rubik's Cube (PyCube).


### Dependencies

This program utilizes the following Python modules:
[OpenGL](https://www.opengl.org/)
[Pygame](http://pygame.org/)

### Notable Mentions

This post from stackoverflow was very helpful in creating a solid starting point
to use quaternions to rotate a 3 dimensional cube using Python and OpenGL.
